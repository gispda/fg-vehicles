<propeller name="Swedish Navy 20m MTB propeller (power sink)">

 <documentation>
  This propeller is designed to draw a controllable amount of power
  while producing no thrust.

  The thrust, which in this case is from a marine propeller, is modelled
  and applied separately, see propulsion.xml.

  The following system is used to set the blade angle of this "propeller"
  to draw the amount of power required by the marine propeller from the engine.

   The intertia is assumed to be
     n * 1/3*m_b*(d^2)/4
   where
     n is the number of blades,
     m_b is the mass of a blade and
     d is the diameter.

   2/3 of the total propeller weight is assumed to be in the blades.
