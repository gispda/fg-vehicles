# FlightGear Vehicles
This repository contains flightgear aircraft and other vehicles. 

* ground-vehicle: This car is used in cooperative control experiments. It is described [here](https://github.com/laperss/fg-cc-sim).
* sea-vehicle: The sea vehicle is based on work found [here](http://wiki.flightgear.org/Swedish_Navy_T21_class_MTB). The ship has been remade to have slightly different properties and the weapons have been removed.
